# Generating-Image

This was a final assignment for my 2SO3 - Principles of Programming class.

In this assignment, we had to use genetic algorithms to create a series of pictures via randomizing pixels, finally selecting the image that is closest to the input one.

To run with the bird photo, type "make escher." To run with the McMaster logo type "make mcmaster."
